## Lesson 1: Introduction to NumPy

### 1.1 What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance, multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays.

### 1.2 Installing NumPy
To install NumPy, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install numpy
```

### 1.3 Importing NumPy
To use NumPy in your Python script, import the library using the following command:
```
import numpy as np
```

## Lesson 2: NumPy Arrays

### 2.1 Creating NumPy Arrays
NumPy arrays are the main building blocks of the library. You can create NumPy arrays using various methods, such as np.array(), np.zeros(), np.ones(), and np.arange().
```
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

### 2.2 Array Attributes
NumPy arrays have several useful attributes, including dtype (data type), shape (dimensions), and size (number of elements).
```
print(arr.dtype)  # int64
print(arr.shape)  # (5,)
print(arr.size)   # 5
```

### 2.3 Array Indexing and Slicing
NumPy arrays support indexing and slicing, similar to Python lists.
```
print(arr[0])     # 1
print(arr[-1])    # 5
print(arr[1:4])   # [2 3 4]
```

---
## Lesson 3: Array Manipulation

### 3.1 Reshaping Arrays
You can change the shape of a NumPy array using the reshape() function.
```
arr_2d = arr.reshape(5, 1)
```

### 3.2 Concatenating Arrays
Use np.concatenate() to join two or more arrays along an existing axis.
```
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
arr_combined = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))  # [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

### 3.3 Splitting Arrays
Use np.split(), np.hsplit(), or np.vsplit() to split an array into multiple subarrays along a specified axis.
```
arr_split = np.split(arr_combined, 2)  # [array([1, 2, 3]), array([4, 5, 6])]
```

---
## Lesson 4: Basic Array Operations

### 4.1 Arithmetic Operations
NumPy arrays support element-wise arithmetic operations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

result = a + b  # [5 7 9]
```

### 4.2 Broadcasting
Broadcasting allows you to perform arithmetic operations on arrays with different shapes that are compatible in terms of their dimensions.
```
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = np.array([1, 2, 3])

result = a + b  # [[2 4 6]
                #  [5 7 9]]
```

### 4.3 Universal Functions (ufuncs)
NumPy provides universal functions (ufuncs) that perform element-wise operations on arrays. Some common ufuncs include np.exp(), np.sqrt(), and np.sin().
```
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
result = np.exp(x)  # [2.71828183 7.3890561  20.08553692]
```

### 4.4 Aggregation Functions
NumPy provides aggregation functions to compute summary statistics on arrays, such as np.sum(), np.mean(), and np.std().
```
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr_sum = np.sum(arr)  # 15
```

---
## Lesson 5: Linear Algebra with NumPy

### 5.1 Matrix Multiplication
Use the np.dot() function or the '@' operator to perform matrix multiplication.
```
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

result = A @ B  # [[19 22]
                #  [43 50]]
```

### 5.2 Determinant and Inverse
Use np.linalg.det() to compute the determinant of a square matrix and np.linalg.inv() to compute its inverse.
```
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
det = np.linalg.det(A)  # -2.0
inverse = np.linalg.inv(A)  # [[-2.   1. ]
                             #  [ 1.5 -0.5]]
```

### 5.3 Solving Linear Equations
Use np.linalg.solve() to solve a system of linear equations represented by Ax = B, where A is a square matrix and x and B are column vectors.
```
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([5, 6])

x = np.linalg.solve(A, B)  # [-4.   4.5]
```

### Lesson 6: Conclusion and Next Steps

## 6.1 Resources for Further Learning
To further explore NumPy and its applications, consider the following resources:
- Official NumPy documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
- Online tutorials and courses (e.g., Coursera, edX)
- Books (e.g., "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney)

## 6.2 Practice Exercises
Practice your NumPy skills with these exercises:
1. Create a NumPy array representing a 5x5 identity matrix.
2. Write a function that computes the Euclidean distance between two points represented as NumPy arrays.
3. Implement a function that calculates the dot product of two vectors without using np.dot() or the '@' operator.
