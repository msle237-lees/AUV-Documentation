This Python script defines and runs a state machine for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using ROS (Robot Operating System) and SMACH (a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behavior). The AUV state machine controls the vehicle's behavior while performing tasks such as navigating through a gate, interacting with buoys, and surfacing.

The script imports various states required for the different tasks, such as searching, tracking, and interacting with the gate, buoy, and octagon objects. The state machine is then created and executed to perform the desired sequence of actions.

**State Machine Creation**
The `createStateMachine` function initializes the ROS node for the AUV state machine and creates a top-level state machine (`sm_AUV`) with the outcome 'finished_run'. Several sub-state machines are also defined for searching different objects, such as `sm_oct_search`, `sm_gate_search`, and `sm_buoy_search`.

**sm_AUV State Transitions**
The top-level state machine `sm_AUV` has the following states and transitions:
1.  `START`: The AUV starts with the `Start()` state, which determines if the gate is found. If not found, the state machine transitions to `SEARCH_GATE`. If found, it transitions to `TRACK_GATE`.
2.  `SEARCH_GATE`: The AUV enters the `sm_gate_search` sub-state machine, searching for the gate. Upon finding the gate, the state machine transitions to `TRACK_GATE`.
3.  `TRACK_GATE`: The AUV tracks the gate. If the gate is lost, the state machine transitions back to `SEARCH_GATE`. If the gate is approached, the state machine transitions to `INTERACT_GATE`.
4.  `INTERACT_GATE`: The AUV interacts with the gate (i.e., navigates through it) and then transitions to `SEARCH_BUOY`.
5.  `SEARCH_BUOY`: The AUV enters the `sm_buoy_search` sub-state machine, searching for the buoy. Upon finding the buoy, the state machine transitions to `TRACK_BUOY`.
6.  `TRACK_BUOY`: The AUV tracks the buoy. If the buoy is lost, the state machine transitions back to `SEARCH_BUOY`. If the buoy is locked onto, the state machine transitions to `INTERACT_BUOY`.
7.  `INTERACT_BUOY`: The AUV interacts with the buoy (e.g., touching or moving it) and then transitions to the `SURFACE` state.
8.  `SURFACE`: The AUV surfaces and finishes the run.

**Sub-State Machines**
`sm_gate_search`, `sm_buoy_search`, and `sm_oct_search` are sub-state machines responsible for searching their respective objects. Each of these sub-state machines has states for searching front, left, right, and re-centering. The transitions between these states are designed to search the area thoroughly, cycling through the different search directions until the object is found.

**Main Function**
The `main` function calls the `createStateMachine` function to create and execute the AUV state machine. This script is intended to be run as a standalone program.

**State Machine Details**
Here are additional details regarding the states and transitions within the sub-state machines for searching the gate, buoy, and octagon:
1.  `sm_gate_search`: The gate search sub-state machine consists of the following states and transitions:
    -   `SEARCH_FRONT_GATE`: Searches for the gate in front of the AUV. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions to `SEARCH_LEFT_GATE`.
    -   `SEARCH_LEFT_GATE`: Searches for the gate to the left of the AUV. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions to `SEARCH_RIGHT_GATE`.
    -   `SEARCH_RIGHT_GATE`: Searches for the gate to the right of the AUV. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions to `SEARCH_RECENTER_GATE`.
    -   `SEARCH_RECENTER_GATE`: Recenters the search for the gate. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions back to `SEARCH_FRONT_GATE`.
2.  `sm_buoy_search`: The buoy search sub-state machine consists of the following states and transitions:
    -   `SEARCH_FRONT_BUOY`: Searches for the buoy in front of the AUV. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions to `SEARCH_LEFT_BUOY`.
    -   `SEARCH_LEFT_BUOY`: Searches for the buoy to the left of the AUV. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions to `SEARCH_RIGHT_BUOY`.
    -   `SEARCH_RIGHT_BUOY`: Searches for the buoy to the right of the AUV. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions to `SEARCH_RECENTER_BUOY`.
    -   `SEARCH_RECENTER_BUOY`: Recenters the search for the buoy. If the object is found, the state machine transitions to 'search_found'. If not found, it transitions back to `SEARCH_FRONT_BUOY`.
The `sm_oct_search` sub-state machine follows a similar structure to `sm_gate_search` and `sm_buoy_search`, but searches for the octagon object instead.

**Usage**

To use this script, make sure that the required state imports are installed and available in your Python environment. Then, run the script in your terminal or command prompt with:
```bash
python2 your_script_name.py
```

The state machine will start executing, and the AUV will perform the tasks as defined by the sequence of states and transitions within the state machine. The ROS infrastructure will manage the communication and data exchange between the different states and the AUV's sensors and actuators.
