The `Detection` class is a simple Python class designed to represent an object detection result. It contains information about the detection, including the confidence score, bounding box, and class ID.

## Class Definition
```python
class Detection:
    def __init__(self, score, box, class_id):
        self.score = score
        self.box = box
        self.class_id = class_id
```

### Attributes
-   `score`: The confidence score of the object detection, typically a floating-point value between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate higher confidence in the detection.
-   `box`: The bounding box of the detected object, usually represented as a tuple or list of four values (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max), where (x_min, y_min) is the top-left corner and (x_max, y_max) is the bottom-right corner of the bounding box.
-   `class_id`: The class ID of the detected object, typically an integer value that corresponds to a specific object class in a predefined list of classes.

### Constructor
The constructor of the `Detection` class takes three arguments and initializes the corresponding attributes:
```python
def __init__(self, score, box, class_id):
    self.score = score
    self.box = box
    self.class_id = class_id
```

## Usage
To create a `Detection` object, you need to provide the required arguments to the constructor:
```python
detection = Detection(score=0.95, box=(10, 20, 30, 40), class_id=1)
```
This creates a `Detection` object with a confidence score of 0.95, a bounding box with coordinates (10, 20, 30, 40), and a class ID of 1.

After creating a `Detection` object, you can access its attributes using the dot notation:
```python
print(detection.score)  # 0.95
print(detection.box)  # (10, 20, 30, 40)
print(detection.class_id)  # 1
```

In summary, the `Detection` class is a simple Python class for representing object detection results, including the confidence score, bounding box, and class ID. The class can be easily initialized and used to store detection information in a structured manner.
