This C++ script initializes a ROS node called "ai_control_node" and creates an instance of the `controller::AIController` class. The script then calls the `ControlLoop()` function to process channels and communicate with the AUV's flight control unit (FCU).

## Dependencies

-   ROS (Robot Operating System)
-   `controller::AIController` class (not provided)

## Main Function

### main(int argc, char **argv)

The main function initializes the "ai_control_node" ROS node and performs the following steps:

1.  Create an instance of the `controller::AIController` class called `aiController`.
2.  (Optional) Uncomment the `aiController->Arm();` line to arm the AUV's FCU before starting the control loop.
3.  Call the `ControlLoop()` function of the `aiController` object to continuously process channels and communicate with the AUV's FCU.

## Limitations and Future Work

-   The `controller::AIController` class is not provided. Ensure that you include the appropriate header file and implement the class to control the AUV.
-   The script does not implement any specific control algorithms or AI-based logic. Implement the desired control algorithms or AI techniques within the `controller::AIController` class.
-   The script does not handle error scenarios, such as communication issues with the AUV's FCU or issues with the ROS node. Consider adding error handling to improve the script's robustness.
-   The script does not provide any user interface or visualization tools. Consider integrating this script with other ROS tools for visualization or monitoring the AUV's status.
